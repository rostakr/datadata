# A5 selective AI analysis

A5 is the interpretive layer of Analyzazprav. It never replaces deterministic A2–A4 processing. It receives only a bounded, relevant context and returns structured, evidence-backed interpretations.

## Core guarantees

- local-first provider abstraction; Ollama is the default implementation
- deterministic candidate selection before AI inference
- chronological context with physical blind-mode cutoffs
- bounded context reduction that preserves explicit evidence
- exactly one repair attempt after invalid model output
- cache keyed by context, analysis type, mode, provider/model and prompt version
- every material claim must resolve to supplied source evidence
- invalid or duplicate evidence IDs fail closed

## Evidence chain

The model is allowed to cite only existing message IDs and existing deterministic metric references. After validation, A5 enriches those references from `AnalysisContext` with the authoritative message timestamp, sender ID, safe excerpt and metric value. The model therefore cannot invent provenance metadata.

Assertion-bearing synthesis retains A6-compatible text fields with parallel source-derived evidence refs:

- `summary` + `summary_evidence`
- `turning_points` + `turning_point_evidence`
- `participant_p1` + `participant_p1_evidence`
- `participant_p2` + `participant_p2_evidence`
- `shared_dynamic` + `shared_dynamic_evidence`

Prompt/cache contract: `a5-v3-assertion-evidence`.

## A2 handoff

`A2SQLiteMessageSource` reads canonical analytical views in read-only mode and provides message IDs, participant IDs, UTC timestamps, reply relations, attachment MIME types and edited/deleted flags.

## A4 v6 handoff

The current A4 contract is used as a deterministic candidate index. A5 adapters accept:

- `ConflictCandidate` → `conflict`
- `ChangePoint` → `change_point`
- `EngagementPeriodSignal` → `engagement_signal`
- `DyadicRegime` → `dyadic_regime`
- `TopicCandidate` → `lexical_topic`
- `AnalyticMessage` → bounded A5 message context

A4 metric names, directions and regime labels remain deterministic source signals; A5 does not silently reinterpret them as motives or psychological facts.

For ordinary candidates, all A4 `source_message_ids` are preserved directly as A5 evidence IDs. An oversized `lexical_topic` is the one intentional structural exception: the authoritative A4 topic row and its complete `source_message_ids` remain unchanged, while `A4SQLiteCandidateSource` creates a deterministic chronological partition for A5. Each chunk contains at most 120 explicit evidence messages, keeps `candidate_type=lexical_topic`, carries stable parent/chunk metadata, and all chunks together must cover the original A4 evidence exactly once. No evidence is sampled or silently discarded, and the global `ContextBuilder.max_messages` limit is not increased.

The chunk size deliberately leaves room inside the 180-message A5 context budget for neighboring context around explicit evidence. `ContextBuilder` still treats every evidence ID inside an individual chunk as an absolute constraint.

`A4SQLiteCandidateSource` reads the published `analysis_a4_*` SQLite views directly in read-only mode. Malformed JSON and duplicate source IDs fail closed. Missing optional views only disable that candidate type. Oversized topic chunking also fails closed if any topic evidence ID cannot be resolved to a timestamped canonical analytical message.

Lexical topic candidates remain explicitly lexical (`lexical_ngram_v1`). A5 may interpret their surrounding message evidence, but the candidate itself is not promoted to semantic truth.

## A6 handoff

`integration_a6.py` accepts A6 `analysis_packet` schema v1. Selected message IDs become explicit manual evidence and can produce both an A5 request and a bounded message source. Duplicate packet message IDs or duplicate selected IDs are rejected.

The current A6 PR renderer already consumes the finalized parallel evidence fields through its assertion/evidence drill-down path, so no additional A5-side compatibility shim is needed.

## Golden deterministic E2E slice

`tests/a5_ai/test_golden_e2e.py` validates one synthetic SQLite database through the full A5 integration boundary:

`A4 analysis_a4_events -> A4SQLiteCandidateSource -> A2 analysis_messages -> ContextBuilder -> StaticProvider -> validated A5 result -> A6 analysis_packet candidate`

The test proves that the same canonical message IDs survive from the A4 finding through source-derived A5 evidence and into the A6 handoff. It also verifies deterministic metric evidence (`conflict_score`) and source-derived sender/timestamp/excerpt data without any external AI service.

`tests/a5_ai/test_a4_topic_chunking.py` separately verifies that oversized lexical-topic evidence is chronologically partitioned without loss or duplication and that every resulting chunk stays within the bounded A5 context contract.

This is intentionally a CI-safe golden integration slice. A7 PR #11 has been notified of the finalized A5 contract and this golden handoff. The final project release gate still requires the stacked A1→A7 pipeline to be assembled and independently reconciled by A7 on the integrated database.

## Failure isolation

If the model is unavailable, times out or produces invalid evidence, A5 returns an explicit failure status. A1–A4 and A6 remain usable; AI is enrichment, never a data-path dependency.
